# Running Crowd

This is a simple simulation of running crowd in OpenGL.

## Controls
- three cameras (press V to switch)
- switching between people (press C)

## Remarks
This project was created as an excercise on my university. It's a simple implementation, just to learn how to use OpenGL.

## Compilation
To compile unzip `lib.zip` first. To launch the application copy `RunningCrowd\Shaders` and `RunningCrowd\glew32.dll` to the directory with `RunningCrowd.exe`.
